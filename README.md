Implements custom datatype API for MPI.

## Building

To install Rust, take a look at <https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install>.

This will require an installation of UCX (>=1.12). Make sure to set
`PKG_CONFIG_PATH` if not using a system-install.

Once all dependencies are installed and the environment configured, you can
build the project with `cargo build --release`.
